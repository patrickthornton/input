# Project: Input - WIP

i'm deliberately throwing together a number of new technologies for me; this is developed in *svelte* and *typescript* (just javascript with extra syntax for type declarations), managed and run with *bun*, and depends on the *fullcalendar* library for the calendar functionality.

i'm using *bun*, but *npm* works just as well, i think; just sub `npm` for `bun` in the following lines.

install bun:
```bash
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun
```
install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```
run:
```bash
bun run dev
```
