# Project: Input - WIP

i'm deliberately throwing together a number of new technologies for me; this is developed in _svelte_ and _typescript_ (just javascript with extra syntax for type declarations), and managed and run with _bun_.

i'm using _bun_, but _npm_ works just as well, i think; just sub `npm` for `bun` in the following lines.

install bun:

```bash
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun
```

install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

run:

```bash
bun run dev
```
